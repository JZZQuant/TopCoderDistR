Prior to deployment, analysis of the host environment in terms of suitability and compatibility must be undertaken. When I say suitability, Im talking about whether the infrastructure can host and deliver the Windows 7 image together with all the other files involved e.g. drivers, updates, applications etc.", "As for Windows 7 compatibility, this must consider both applications and hardware. Analysis must be undertaken to determine whether a successful deployment requires new PC hardware be provisioned or maybe just requires new drivers. In other words, whether it is appropriate to undertake bare metal or refresh deployments.Irrespective of the approach taken, application compatibility must also be consideredwell before undertaking any deployment.", "In this issue of our Windows 7 Deployment series, I compare the 2 common Windows 7 Zero-touch deployment scenarios of bare-metal and refresh. Depending on the specification of your current PC hardware, Windows 7 deployment may involve one or both approaches.", "Before I go any further, let me clarify exactly what we mean by these terms:", "Bare-metal  this scenario should really be called new hardware as we include both empty disk and prestaged media approaches. Both types of deployment can be initiated via removable media or more typical for large environments, via PXE boot. We will concentrate on the PXE boot approach here.", "Refresh  in this scenario the deployment is initiated from the existing operating system via a ConfigMgr advertised program.", "let us take a closer look at the 2 new hardware scenarios commonly available:", "Bare-metal or Prestaged media", "New hardware is either supplied with no (usable) OS installed, or prestaged with the operating system and boot images (support for prestaging the operating system and boot images was introduced in ConfigMgr R3). The latter option obviously provides advantages in terms of lessening the time needed to deploy the new operating system once the hardware has arrived. ConfigMgr facilitates both scenarios through deployment of the appropriate task sequence. So how is the prestage accomplished in ConfigMgr? Well, basically, you would create a task sequence media WIM file using a wizard in the ConfigMgr administration console. This would then be shipped to the OEM where they would deploy this onto the new hardware. Once the new hardware has arrived from the OEM, the machine can be PXE booted and targeted with a task sequence to complete the deployment. The final task sequence will typically install drivers, updates and applications. The prestage scenario therefore can save considerable time and bandwidth copying and installing the image  especially where the locations are not well connected to a distribution point server or does not make use of 1E PXE Lite.", "Despite the advantages, prestaging may not suit all organisations. It can be argued that the time saved in performing deployments must be balanced against the extra effort and time required to implement any change to the image once the original has been shipped to the OEM. However, since things such as drivers, updates and applications are installed in the post prestage deployment, it is likely that this will be infrequent, for instance upon release of a service pack.", "Pre-Deployment", "User State Capture and restore", "The process of user state capture in a new hardware scenario is different to that which takes place during a refresh mainly in the fact that user data cannot be stored locally on the machine being built. Without PXELite, this necessitates the use of a ConfigMgr State Migration Pointserver (SMP). Deployment of SMPs can therefore demand the same consideration as when deploying Distribution Point servers if excessive WAN traffic is to be avoided.", "User state capture and restore is accomplished using the Microsoft User State Migration Tool (USMT). For a refresh scenario, USMT v4 allows migration data to be retained on the local disk throughout the deployment process using hardlinks. This results in minimal local storage requirements which also speeds up the capture and restore process. However, this feature is only available when upgrading from Vista to Windows 7. If upgrading from XP, then SMPs may still be required if the machine runs short on disk space.", "Another difference is that bare-metal requires a Computer Association (CA) object, which must first be created in the site before data capture can take place. The CA maps the source and (new) target machines within ConfigMgr. Pre-creation of the CA can be too restrictive for some customers and 1E have adapted the bare-metal process to make the process of capture and restore as seamless as possible.", "In our experience, it is also important that the state capture process takes place at the right time in terms of ensuring all data is captured without inconvenience to the user. This goes for both the bare-metal and refresh scenarios. 1E Shopping can facilitate this by allowing the user to decide when to run the state capture on their old machine, or to refresh their existing machine.", "Running the Deployment", "Accessing Deployment Packages", "PXE Lite facilitates PXE booting, image deployment and user data storage without the need for any local ConfigMgr site systems (PXE Service Point, Distribution Point and State Migration Point). Typically, the nominated PXE Lite Local server or workstation (with the Nomad agent installed) has the deployment packages pre-cached and is able to serve these to deployments occurring on the local subnet. This is for both new hardware and refresh scenarios. A PXE Lite enabled task sequence means that the deployment process can be entirely contained within the subnet.", "To simplify the deployment and administration process, some of our customers use PXE Lite throughout their entire environment rather than just in their branch offices. Typically Distribution Points are still used in the larger sites for content distribution .", "Facilitating a Speedy Refresh", "Preserving application files that have been cached locally prior to OS deployment is important if application installation during the refresh is to complete as quickly as possible. If Nomad has been used to perform application deployments prior to the refresh, then Save and Restore Nomad Branch Cache steps can be added to the refresh task sequence to facilitate this as shown below:", "", "If you found this article interesting, please take a moment to share it with your contacts using the social media buttons to the left."], "Author": ["Simon Burbidge"], "Date": "2010-11-15 00:00:00"}, {"Tags": [], "URL": "http://blogs.1e.com/2010/11/15/nightwatchman-sql-service-accounts-split-install-scenario/", "Area": ["1E News"], "Comments": [{"Comment": "Pingback: NightWatchman / SQL Service Accounts  Split Install Scenario - 1E Blog", "Author": "NightWatchman / SQL Service Accounts  Split Install Scenario - 1E Blog"}, {"Comment": "Pingback: NightWatchman / SQL Service Accounts ", "Author": "NightWatchman / SQL Service Accounts "}], "Content": [], "Author": ["wayne underwood"], "Date": "2010-11-15 00:00:00"}, {"Tags": ["data center", "green grid", "green it", "unused servers", "useful work"], "URL": "http://blogs.1e.com/2010/11/13/new-green-grid-whitepaper-unused-servers-survey-results-analysis/", "Area": ["Data Center", "Green IT", "IT Efficiency"], "Comments": [{"Comment": "Pingback: New Green Grid Whitepaper: Unused Servers Survey Results Analysis - 1E Blog", "Author": "New Green Grid Whitepaper: Unused Servers Survey Results Analysis - 1E Blog"}, {"Comment": "Pingback: Tweets that mention New Green Grid Whitepaper: Unused Servers Survey Results Analysis | 1E Blogs -- Topsy.com", "Author": "Tweets that mention New Green Grid Whitepaper: Unused Servers Survey Results Analysis | 1E Blogs -- Topsy.com"}, {"Comment": "Really a great whitepaper, thanks for sharing.

I cant think of any company who hasnt either implemented or considered virtualization. With Server hardware advancing leaps and bounds, and disk space becoming ever cheaper and more plentiful, the ability to partition that space into multiple virtual server environments or Virtual Machines (VMs) has provided many benefits. For data center managers, it makes provisioning new servers a simple task. Extra server capacity can be brought online as and when required, with no additional hardware involved, and a low admin requirement. Once your virtual server image is created, you can have your new army of virtual playgrounds ready and waiting. If a customer needs a server fast  just start one up.", "In IT test or development departments it means that developers or tester teamscan have access to a new server build at the click of a mouse, which they can then play with, before ditching it and starting up a new one.", "So it all sounds amazing, but as we know from past experience, nothing is for nothing. Enter Virtual Sprawl.", "Virtual sprawl can be described as the unmanaged spread of VMs without adequate management or control. Or, its a bit like my workshop at home, which suffers from the unmanaged spread of tools and other items without any management or control whatsoever.", "I think that initially there was a general perception that because VMs are so easy to create and keep on standby they are somehow invisible to cost. If only.", "Some time ago I read that the costs associated with virtual servers can be broadly split into four categories. These are infrastructure, management systems, server software, and administration. So you need a physical box on which to host the virtual system, the server software (be that Windows or Unix etc), some admin time and some kind of management  virtual servers need patching too!", "However, I would add a fifth category to the above. Each VM that is out there and running is using up energy in the form of the electricity used to power the host server and disks. Just like a real server, a VM needs aslice of the processor time, memory and other hardware services.", "It shouldnt all be cost however. If a company decides to implement a virtualization project, the savings can be immediate and quite significant. Depending on the level of virtualization, hundreds or indeed thousands of physical servers can be decomissioned. Once this has been achieved however, its easy for the rot to set in. Once customers (either internal or external) get to know how easy it is for a VM to be deployed, it creates demand for more and more servers. The number of VMs creeps up and up until you reach a situation where the very cost savings of virtualization have been wiped out and you have a rapidly growing problem on your hands.", "Visibility is the Key", "However, it is also the perfect tool for monitoring your VMs once deployed.You can setup regular monitoring and reporting so that you can easily identify any VM which is running but no longer performing its original task, or is simply under utilised. Consolidation should not be a one-off task, and VMs can and should be included in an ongoing server waste-management plan.", "If you suspect that you already have a bad case of virtual sprawl out there, and may have VMs out in the wild that are no longer required, you can also use NWSE to track them down and bring them under control. NWSE can easily highlight VMs which were commissioned in haste (perhaps for a one-off project) and are no longer in use. Or perhaps a whole group of VMs were ordered for a project that is now complete. Once these so called orphaned VMs are identified you can reclaim valuable disk space as well as reducing your energy usage."], "Author": ["Phil Wilcock"], "Date": "2010-10-22 00:00:00"}, {"Tags": [], "URL": "http://blogs.1e.com/2010/10/21/pc-and-server-energy-efficiency-reports/", "Area": ["1E Products", "Green IT", "PC Power Management", "Server Power Management"], "Comments": "", "Content": ["These 3rd party research reports provide depth, understanding, and accuracy about the situation of PC and Server power management and efficiency.
